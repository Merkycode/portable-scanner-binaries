Static Network Scanner Binaries
Fully static builds of Nmap and Masscan for x86_64 Linux systems with zero runtime dependencies. These binaries run on any Linux system with kernel 2.6.32 or newer without requiring library installations.

Why Static Binaries?
Static binaries are useful in environments where:

You cannot install dependencies (restricted/embedded systems)
Target systems have missing or incompatible libraries
You need guaranteed portability across different Linux distributions
Working in containers, Cisco network devices (GuestShell), or minimal Linux installations

These binaries have zero external dependencies - everything is compiled into the executable.
System Requirements

x86_64 Linux system
Kernel 2.6.32 or newer (virtually all modern Linux distributions)
Root privileges or CAP_NET_RAW capability for raw socket operations (required for most scan types)

Installation
Download the appropriate archive and extract:
bash# Download from releases
wget https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME/releases/download/VERSION/nmap-7.60-static-x86_64.tar.gz
wget https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME/releases/download/VERSION/masscan-static-x86_64.tar.gz

# Extract
tar xzf nmap-7.60-static-x86_64.tar.gz
tar xzf masscan-static-x86_64.tar.gz

# Optional: Move to system PATH
sudo mv nmap masscan /usr/local/bin/

# Make executable (if needed)
chmod +x nmap masscan
Verification
Confirm these are truly static binaries with no dependencies:
bash$ ldd nmap
    not a dynamic executable

$ ldd masscan
    not a dynamic executable

$ file nmap
nmap: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, stripped

$ file masscan
masscan: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, stripped
Usage Examples
Nmap
bash# Basic ping scan
./nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

# Port scan with version detection
sudo ./nmap -sV -p- 192.168.1.1

# Script scan
sudo ./nmap -sC -sV target.com

# Check version
./nmap --version
Masscan
bash# Fast port scan
sudo ./masscan -p80,443,8080 192.168.1.0/24 --rate=10000

# Scan entire TCP port range
sudo ./masscan -p0-65535 10.0.0.0/8 --rate=100000

# Output to file
sudo ./masscan -p80,443 192.168.1.0/24 --rate=1000 -oG results.txt

# Check version
./masscan --version
Important Notes
Root Privileges
Both tools require root privileges (or CAP_NET_RAW capability) for most scan types that use raw sockets. Use sudo when running scans.
glibc NSS Warnings
You may see warnings like:
warning: Using 'getaddrinfo' in statically linked applications requires 
at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking
This is normal and expected for static binaries. These warnings refer to Name Service Switch (NSS) plugins that glibc may attempt to load dynamically for DNS resolution. The tools will still function correctly in most cases.
Testing
Always test in a controlled environment first. Verify the binaries work in your specific target environment before deploying to production systems.
Build Information
These binaries were built on CentOS 7 to ensure compatibility with older Linux systems. They include:
Nmap Dependencies (all statically linked)

OpenSSL 1.0.2u (built without Kerberos)
libpcap 1.5.3
libssh2 1.8.0
PCRE 8.32
zlib 1.2.8
Lua 5.3.3
