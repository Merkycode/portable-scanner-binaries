# Static Network Scanner Binaries

Fully static builds of Nmap and Masscan for x86_64 Linux systems with zero runtime dependencies. These binaries run on any Linux system with kernel 2.6.32 or newer without requiring library installations.

## Contents

| Tool | Version | Stripped Size | Compressed Size | Features |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Nmap** | 7.60 | 7.8 MB | 3.1 MB | Lua scripting, OpenSSL, libssh2, pcre, libpcap, IPv6 |
| **Masscan** | 1.3.9 | 1.4 MB | 607 KB | High-speed port scanner |

## Why Static Binaries?

Static binaries are useful in environments where:
- You cannot install dependencies (restricted/embedded systems)
- Target systems have missing or incompatible libraries
- You need guaranteed portability across different Linux distributions
- Working in containers, Cisco network devices (GuestShell), or minimal Linux installations

These binaries have **zero external dependencies** - everything is compiled into the executable.

## System Requirements

- x86_64 Linux system
- Kernel 2.6.32 or newer (virtually all modern Linux distributions)
- Root privileges or `CAP_NET_RAW` capability for raw socket operations (required for most scan types)

## Installation

Download the appropriate archive and extract:
```bash
# Download from releases
wget https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME/releases/download/VERSION/nmap-7.60-static-x86_64.tar.gz
